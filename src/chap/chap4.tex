\chapter{The background after the LAr veto cut}

All what has been shown until now concerns data before the LAr and PSD cut. In this
chapter a model of the background after the LAr veto cut will be presented, based on a
Monte Carlo simulation of the LAr scintillation light propagation. Being able to describe
the background after this major event selection is indeed of great interest to study the
distribution of two-neutrino double-beta decay events, which are almost never vetoed by
the LAr veto system. As extensively shown in \cref{chap:theory}, the presence of several
new physics phenomena can be constrained by looking at the shape of the \nnbb\ events
distribution. Understanding the action of the LAr veto cut on background events from the
point of view of the background model requires, however, a full Monte Carlo simulation of
the LAr scintillation mechanism as well as the optical properties of all the relevant
materials and surfaces that contribute to propagate light in the \gerda\ experimental
setup.
