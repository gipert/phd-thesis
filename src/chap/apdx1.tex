\chapter{Assay measurements}%
\label{apdx:assay}

This is a collection of the information that can be derived from screening measurements
done for \gerda\ \phasetwo. The measurements are converted to useful units for the
characterisation of prior distributions in the background modeling and other analysis. For
each measurement a recommendation is given on how to properly use the values. Part of
these measurements are published also in~\cite{Agostini2018a}.

  \caption{%
    Activity of \gerda\ PhaseII components calculated from radio-purity screening
    measurements. The following isotopes are in secular equilibrium: [$^{228}$Ra, \Ac]
    [\Ra, \Bih, \Pbh] [\Th, \Bil, \Tl] (branching ratio of \Tl\ is 0.36) [\Uh, \Pa].
    Values colored in green can be used as priors for PhaseII background modeling as they
    are; values colored in light blue have to be multiplied by 2/3. This is an
    approximation for the shortening of the cables before deployment in \gerda.
