\chapter{Germanium detector models}%
\label{apdx:gedetav}

As a result of the presence of the \nplus\ contact on the outer surface of the germanium
detectors, the charge-collection efficiency (CCE) differs from unity in the region close
to the contact. As a matter of fact, lithium impurities diffused inside the crystal during
the \nplus\ contact fabrication process act as recombination centers for charge carriers, and the
CCE curve strongly depends on the lithium concentration profile. Such a situation
typically leads to events depositing energy in this region being characterized by a lower
reconstructed energy, depending on the local CCE. Since the \pplus\ contact is
boron-implanted, it is expected to have a thin dead layer, on the order of 1~\mum, and it
will not be considered in the following. The reader is referred
to~\cite{Lehnert2016} for an extensive discussion of the charge-collection mechanism in
germanium detectors and CCE models.

    increases until reaching its maximal value in the fully active volume.

\blocktitle{fully \\ active \\ volume}
The full charge-collection depth (FCCD), defined as the depth at which the CCE reaches
unity, has been estimated for each germanium detector deployed in \gerda\ at the \nplus\
contact during dedicated characterization campaigns. In these measurements, a radioactive
source (e.g.~\Am, \Ba, \Co) is positioned close to the detector surface to sample its
energy spectrum. A matching between data and Monte Carlo simulations is then performed to
find the FCCD value that best describes data. The recommended FCCD values obtained from
this characterization data are reported in \cref{tab:gedetav:official}. The \scoax\ values
are extracted from \Co\ data as documented in~\cite{Heider2009}, while the \bege\ values
are obtained combining \Am\ and \Ba\ data~\cite{Agostini2019}. \icoax\ values are
extracted from \Am\ measurements. The \bege\ detectors have been stored at room
temperature in the time interval between their characterization to the deployment in
liquid argon, and must be therefore corrected for the dead-layer growing effect. The
growth speed at room temperature has never been determined rigorously, and the best
available estimate is of about $\sim{}0.1$~mm/yr, with a standard deviation of 0.04~mm/yr
(\cite{Agostini2019} and references therein). The correction is therefore applied
considering the exact time spent by each detector at room temperature together with an
additional systematic uncertainty of 50\%.

    FCCDs are corrected for the dead-layer growing effect at room temperature experienced
    before installment in \gerda~\cite{Agostini2019}. The uncertainties are split into
    correlated and uncorrelated contributions. The DLF values have been estimated
    in~\cite{Lehnert2016} and do not include any growing effect at room temperature.

\blocktitle{transition \\ layer}
The region enclosed by the detector surface and the FCCD is, of course, not completely
dead, and regions with reduced CCE are expected. The CCE curve in this region strongly
depends on the lithium concentration profile, which is in turn strongly dependent on the
diode fabrication process (initial lithium concentration at the surface, thermal annealing
cycles etc.) and is \emph{a priori} different for each detector. As a consequence, the
transition region must be characterized for each detector individually, e.g.~in a similar
way as FCCD is determined from external source data.
\newpar
It is important to stress here that a precise characterization of the transition layer is
not needed for the \onbb\ analysis, as the introduction of a partially-active region above
the FCCD results in hypothetical, new \onbb\ events below the \qbb. \onbb\ events
originating in this transition region would in fact be detected with an effectively lower
energy and therefore `get out' of the gaussian peak at \qbb, which is what the experiment
looks for. In summary, the presence of a non-null transition layer would have no impact on
the signal detection efficiency defined for the \onbb\ analysis. Constraining the CCE
curve is instead very important for the \nnbb\ analysis. Different transition layer models
result in shape distortions of the \nnbb\ energy distribution that can potentially mimic
the presence of new-physics phenomena (e.g.~those considered in
\cref{sec:nbb:0nbbx,sec:nbb:2nbbLV}). The potential systematic effect due to the
uncertainties in the CCE curve determination is investigated in \cref{?}. Last but not
least, the size of the transition region marginally affects the \thalftwo\ estimate, since
it depends on the total number of detected \nnbb\ events.
\newpar
An attempt to determine the CCE curve for \gerda's \bege\ detectors has been carried on
in~\cite{Lehnert2016}. A simple linear model (the one shown in
\cref{fig:gedetav:tl-model}) has been considered first. Once the FCCD is fixed, the only
parameter that needs to be constrained is the starting point of the transition region,
i.e.~the dead layer thickness (DLT). Monte Carlo simulations performed with different DLTs
have been compared to \Am\ data in order to determine the dead layer fraction (DLF),
defined as
\[
  \text{DLF} = \frac{\text{DLT}}{\text{FCCD}} \in [0,1] \;,
\]
For each \bege\ detector. The results are reproduced in \cref{tab:gedetav:official}. Since
the effect of the lithium concentration profile evolution at room temperature on the
transition region is not known, these values have not been corrected. A more complex
transition layer model has been also derived from first principles in~\cite{Lehnert2016},
but it requires special PSD data from other radioactive sources (\aoe\ from \nuc{Sr}{90}
in~\cite{Lehnert2016}) that was available just for \GD{91C}.

\blocktitle{known \\ issues}
Unfortunately, the active volume model presented above suffers from many uncertainties and
cannot be fully trusted. A systematic discrepancy between FCCD values obtained from
different radioactive sources (\Am, \Ba\ and \Co) has been highlighted and
discussed~\cite{Lehnert2016}, but no convincing explanation of its origin has been
formulated yet. Moreover, the fact that \bege\ detectors were stored at room temperature
for a significant amount of time after being carefully characterized poses an additional
question mark on these FCCD values, as the growing effect has never been carefully studied
in detail. In particular, the size of the transition region extracted from the
characterization data must also be affected by the evolution of the lithium concentration
profile in some way, and cannot be left uncorrected when considering data collected in the
\gerda\ cryostat. Finally, the linear transition layer model could be a bad approximation
in some detectors. Evidence for these systematic discrepancies will be presented in the
following sections.

\section{Insights from \Arl\ data}%
\label{src:gedetav:ar39}

The \gerda\ event spectrum is dominated, at low energies, by \Arl-decay events. This
unstable nucleus is naturally present in the atmosphere and is cosmogenically activated.
It decays to the ground state of $^{39}$K via $\upbeta^-$ decay with a half-life of
269(3)~yr and Q-value of 656(5)~keV. Being commercial liquid argon distilled from air, it
naturally contains a fraction of \Arl, whose activity has been estimated to be of about
1~Bq/kg by various experiments~\cite{Ajaj2019, Calvo2017, Benetti2006, Loosli1983}. The
\Arl\ energy spectrum of events collected by \gerda\ in the first part of \phasetwo\ has
been published in~\cite{Agostini2020}.
\newpar
The \b\ particle emitted in the \Arl\ decay can be detected directly or indirectly in
\gerda. In the first case the electron has to directly reach the detector's active volume.
Since a \b\ particle of that energy has a mean range in germanium of less than 100~\mum\
and the \nplus\ contact is typically several hundreds of \mum\ thick, the only way is
through the \pplus\ electrode. For the same reason, the mother \Arl\ nucleus must decay
very close to the detector surface, i.e.~less than 1~mm far from it. Being the \pplus\
contact a small fraction of the total detector surface, the \b\ component of the \Arl\
spectrum is expected to be sub-dominant or even negligible for point-like contact
detectors such as \bege{}s or \icoax{}s (c.f.r~\cref{fig:gedetav:ar39:distortions}, left).
\newpar
\Arl\ electrons typically emit \emph{bremsstrahlung} radiation in LAr that can reach the
detectors' active volume: this is referred as the `indirect' detection method. Since the
photon absorption length in germanium and liquid argon is much longer than the electrons',
\Arl\ decays originating much further from the detector surface can be detected. Moreover,
\emph{bremsstrahlung} photons can interact with the whole detector volume, and thus
constitute a `volume probe'. It follows from what stated above that the \g\ component
largely dominates the \Arl\ event spectrum (c.f.r.~\cref{fig:gedetav:ar39:distortions}, left).

  \caption{%

    \b\ and \g\ components. Center and right: Impact of different linear transition layer
    model (\cref{fig:gedetav:tl-model}) parameters on the \Arl\ energy spectrum shape,
    keeping the \Arl\ activity in LAr fixed. Left: the dead layer fraction (DLF) is fixed
    to 1 (i.e.~hard step model) and the full charge-collection depth (FCCD) is varied
    between 0.3~mm and 1.5~mm in steps of 0.1~mm. Right: the FCCD is fixed to 0.9~mm and
    the DLF is varied between 0 (i.e.~no dead layer) and 1 (i.e.~no transition layer).
  }\label{fig:gedetav:ar39:distortions}
\end{figure}

\blocktitle{active \\ volume \\ model}
The \Arl\ spectral shape is strongly affected by the germanium detector's active volume
model, as it will be demonstrated in the following. This high-statistics data sample
collected by \gerda\ offers the interesting possibility to tune the active volume model on
a detector-by-detector basis. Let's consider, for the sake of simplicity, the simple linear
transition layer model depicted in \cref{fig:gedetav:tl-model} for the \nplus\ contact.
The effects of variations of its two parameters (the FCCD and the DLF) are shown in
\cref{fig:gedetav:ar39:distortions}. Varying the FCCD (and keeping the DLF fixed at 1,
i.e.~no transition layer) has of course the effect of changing the number of detected
\Arl\ events, but introduces a shape distortion too. The effect of the DLF seems to be
more localized in the low side of the distribution. Clearly, the more the transition layer
extends closer to the surface, the more events with incomplete charge collection appear at
lower energies. Remarkably, both parameters seems to shift the position of the maximum of
the distribution.

\blocktitle{tuning the \\ model}
An attempt to fit the \Arl\ energy spectrum and extract FCCD and DLF values for each
detector has been carried on, whose preliminary results are presented here. The
\phasetwop\ data set has been considered, as the germanium detectors' energy threshold has
been kept low enough (about 40~keV) for the whole data taking. Each detector collected
more than $5 \cdot 10^4$ events below 200~keV, where the bulk of the \Arl\ events is
located. \fillme{fillme}

    represent an uncertainty (see text). Note that DLFs have not been estimated for
    \scoax{}s and \icoax{}s and that some FCCD values from \Arl\ are missing because of
