\chapter{Germanium detector models}%
\label{apdx:gedetav}

As a result of the presence of the \nplus\ contact on the outer surface of the germanium
detectors, the charge-collection efficiency (CCE) differs from unity in the region close
to the contact. As a matter of fact, lithium impurities diffused inside the crystal during
the \nplus\ contact fabrication process act as recombination centers for charge carriers, and the
CCE curve strongly depends on the lithium concentration profile. Such a situation
typically leads to events depositing energy in this region being characterized by a lower
reconstructed energy, depending on the local CCE. Since the \pplus\ contact is
boron-implanted, it is expected to have a thin dead layer, on the order of 1~\mum, and it
will not be considered in the following. The reader is referred
to~\cite{Lehnert2016} for an extensive discussion of the charge-collection mechanism in
germanium detectors and CCE models.

    definition at the outer surface and remains such through all the `dead layer'. The
    detector is partially active in the `transition layer' region, where the CCE gradually
    increases until reaching its maximal value in the fully active volume.
  }\label{fig:gedetav:tl-model}
\end{figure}

\blocktitle{fully \\ active \\ volume}
The full charge-collection depth (FCCD), defined as the depth at which the CCE reaches
unity, has been estimated for each germanium detector deployed in \gerda\ at the \nplus\
contact during dedicated characterization campaigns. In these measurements, a radioactive
source (e.g.~\Am, \Ba, \Co) is positioned close to the detector surface to sample its
energy spectrum. A matching between data and Monte Carlo simulations is then performed to
find the FCCD value that best describes data. The recommended FCCD values obtained from
this characterization data are reported in \cref{tab:gedetav:official}. The \scoax\ values
are extracted from \Co\ data as documented in~\cite{Heider2009}, while the \bege\ values
are obtained combining \Am\ and \Ba\ data~\cite{Agostini2019}. \icoax\ values are
extracted from \Am\ measurements~\cite{Miloradovic2020}. The \bege\ detectors have been stored at room
temperature in the time interval between their characterization to the deployment in
liquid argon, and must be therefore corrected for the dead-layer growing effect. The
growth speed at room temperature has never been determined rigorously, and the best
available estimate is of about $\sim{}0.1$~mm/yr, with a standard deviation of 0.04~mm/yr
(\cite{Agostini2019} and references therein). The correction is therefore applied
considering the exact time spent by each detector at room temperature together with an
additional systematic uncertainty of 50\%.

\blocktitle{transition \\ layer}
The region enclosed by the detector surface and the FCCD is, of course, not completely
dead, and regions with reduced CCE are expected. The CCE curve in this region strongly
depends on the lithium concentration profile, which is in turn strongly dependent on the
diode fabrication process (initial lithium concentration at the surface, thermal annealing
cycles etc.) and is \emph{a priori} different for each detector. As a consequence, the
transition region must be characterized for each detector individually, e.g.~in a similar
way as FCCD is determined from external source data.
\newpar
It is important to stress here that a precise characterization of the transition layer is
not needed for the \onbb\ analysis, as the introduction of a partially-active region above
the FCCD results in hypothetical, new \onbb\ events below the \qbb. \onbb\ events
originating in this transition region would in fact be detected with an effectively lower
energy and therefore `get out' of the gaussian peak at \qbb, which is what the experiment
looks for. In summary, the presence of a non-null transition layer would have no impact on
the signal detection efficiency defined for the \onbb\ analysis. Constraining the CCE
curve is instead very important for the \nnbb\ analysis. Different transition layer models
result in shape distortions of the \nnbb\ energy distribution that can potentially mimic
the presence of new-physics phenomena (e.g.~those considered in
\cref{sec:nbb:0nbbx,sec:nbb:2nbbLV}). The potential systematic effect due to the
uncertainties in the CCE curve determination is investigated in \cref{?}. Last but not
least, the size of the transition region marginally affects the \thalftwo\ estimate, since
it depends on the total number of detected \nnbb\ events.
\newpar
An attempt to determine the CCE curve for \gerda's \bege\ detectors has been carried on
in~\cite{Lehnert2016}. A simple linear model (the one shown in
\cref{fig:gedetav:tl-model}) has been considered first. Once the FCCD is fixed, the only
parameter that needs to be constrained is the starting point of the transition region,
i.e.~the dead layer thickness (DLT). Monte Carlo simulations performed with different DLTs
have been compared to \Am\ data in order to determine the dead layer fraction (DLF),
defined as
\[
  \text{DLF} = \frac{\text{DLT}}{\text{FCCD}} \in [0,1] \;,
\]
For each \bege\ detector. The results are reproduced in \cref{tab:gedetav:official}. Since
the effect of the lithium concentration profile evolution at room temperature on the
transition region is not known, these values have not been corrected. A more complex
transition layer model has been also derived from first principles in~\cite{Lehnert2016},
but it requires special PSD data from other radioactive sources (\aoe\ from \nuc{Sr}{90}
in~\cite{Lehnert2016}) that was available just for \GD{91C}.

\blocktitle{known \\ issues}
Unfortunately, the active volume model presented above suffers from many uncertainties and
cannot be fully trusted. A systematic discrepancy between FCCD values obtained from
different radioactive sources (\Am, \Ba\ and \Co) has been highlighted and
discussed~\cite{Lehnert2016}, but no convincing explanation of its origin has been
formulated yet. Moreover, the fact that \bege\ detectors were stored at room temperature
for a significant amount of time after being carefully characterized poses an additional
question mark on these FCCD values, as the growing effect has never been carefully studied
in detail. In particular, the size of the transition region extracted from the
characterization data must also be affected by the evolution of the lithium concentration
profile in some way, and cannot be left uncorrected when considering data collected in the
\gerda\ cryostat. Finally, the linear transition layer model could be a bad approximation
in some detectors. An evidence for the presence of these systematic biases lies in the
results of the background model presented in \cref{chap:bkg:raw:ph2}, which yields
incompatible \thalftwo\ estimates from different detector types. More evidence in support
of this and possible solutions will be presented in the following sections.

\section{Tuning the \bege\ transition layer model on calibration data}%
\label{sec:gedetav:calib-optim}

The effect of the transition region size on the event energy spectrum is particularly
strong in the lower tail of intense \g\ peaks. Full-energy events interacting in the
transition region are reconstructed with a smaller effective energy, and are therefore
shifted out of the peak. The high-statistics \Tl\ 2615~keV line from calibration data is
an interesting sample that can be used to determine the size of the transition region.
Data from the special \Th\ calibration run 68\footnote{%
  As documented in \cref{sec:bkg:lar:ph2:pcalib}, data from run 68 has been collected with
  low-activity $\mathcal{O}(1)$~kBq \Th\ sources, to study the performance of the liquid
  argon veto system. Since in these experimental conditions the rate of pile-up events is
  much lower than in regular calibrations, this data set is more suited to a comparison
  with Monte Carlo simulations.
} collected by the \GD{02A} detector is shown in the left-hand side of
\cref{fig:gedetav:calib-optim-example}, in red. Pdfs corresponding to different sizes of
the transition region (DLF) are overlaid to demonstrate the effect on the low side of the
full-energy peak.
\newpar
To determine the optimum transition region size the observable $V/P$ is defined, where $V$
(valley) and $P$ (peak) are the total number of counts in the $[2500, 2600]$~keV and
$[2610, 2620]$~keV regions, respectively (the two energy ranges are highlighted in grey in
\cref{fig:gedetav:calib-optim-example}, left). The uncertainty on $V/P$ is obtained by
error propagation of the Poisson uncertainties on $V$ and $P$. Pdfs with dead-layer
fractions from 0 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1 and the FCCDs fixed to the official values in
\cref{tab:gedetav:official} have been produced for each detector, in order to obtain the
predicted $V/P$ values. Since $V/P$ is observed to change linearly upon the dead-layer
fraction, a linear interpolation is performed between the simulated values. The result is
depicted in \cref{fig:gedetav:calib-optim-example}, on the right, for detector \GD{02A}.
Finally, the value of the observable is calculated from data (grey lines) and compared
against the interpolation result in order to find the optimum dead-layer fraction value
(red lines). The results are reported in \cref{tab:gedetav:calib-optim} for each
detector.
\newpar
Unfortunately, not all detectors were active during run 68. Some of them were switched off
because of hardware instabilities, some of them had an unstable energy calibration,
therefore no data is available.

\section{Insights from \Arl\ data}%
\label{sec:gedetav:ar39}

The \gerda\ event spectrum is dominated, at low energies, by \Arl-decay events. This
unstable nucleus is naturally present in the atmosphere and is cosmogenically activated.
It decays to the ground state of $^{39}$K via $\upbeta^-$ decay with a half-life of
269(3)~yr and Q-value of 656(5)~keV. Being commercial liquid argon distilled from air, it
naturally contains a fraction of \Arl, whose activity has been estimated to be of about
1~Bq/kg by various experiments~\cite{Ajaj2019, Calvo2017, Benetti2006, Loosli1983}. The
\Arl\ energy spectrum of events collected by \gerda\ in the first part of \phasetwo\ has
been published in~\cite{Agostini2020}.
\newpar
The \b\ particle emitted in the \Arl\ decay can be detected directly or indirectly in
\gerda. In the first case the electron has to directly reach the detector's active volume.
Since a \b\ particle of that energy has a mean range in germanium of less than 100~\mum\
and the \nplus\ contact is typically several hundreds of \mum\ thick, the only way is
through the \pplus\ electrode. For the same reason, the mother \Arl\ nucleus must decay
very close to the detector surface, i.e.~less than 1~mm far from it. Being the \pplus\
contact a small fraction of the total detector surface, the \b\ component of the \Arl\
spectrum is expected to be sub-dominant or even negligible for point-like contact
detectors such as \bege{}s or \icoax{}s (c.f.r~\cref{fig:gedetav:ar39:distortions}, left).
\newpar
\Arl\ electrons typically emit \emph{bremsstrahlung} radiation in LAr that can reach the
detectors' active volume: this is referred as the `indirect' detection method. Since the
photon absorption length in germanium and liquid argon is much longer than the electrons',
\Arl\ decays originating much further from the detector surface can be detected. Moreover,
\emph{bremsstrahlung} photons can interact with the whole detector volume, and thus
constitute a `volume probe'. It follows from what stated above that the \g\ component
largely dominates the \Arl\ event spectrum (c.f.r.~\cref{fig:gedetav:ar39:distortions}, left).

  \caption{%

    the DLF is varied between 0 (i.e.~no dead layer) and 1 (i.e.~no transition layer).
  }\label{fig:gedetav:ar39:distortions}
\end{figure}

\blocktitle{active \\ volume \\ model}
The \Arl\ spectral shape is strongly affected by the germanium detector's active volume
model, as it will be demonstrated in the following. This high-statistics data sample
collected by \gerda\ offers the interesting possibility to tune the active volume model on
a detector-by-detector basis. Let's consider, for the sake of simplicity, the simple linear
transition layer model depicted in \cref{fig:gedetav:tl-model} for the \nplus\ contact.
The effects of variations of its two parameters (the FCCD and the DLF) are shown in
\cref{fig:gedetav:ar39:distortions}. Varying the FCCD (and keeping the DLF fixed at 1,
i.e.~no transition layer) has of course the effect of changing the number of detected
\Arl\ events, but introduces a shape distortion too. The effect of the DLF seems to be
more localized in the low side of the distribution. Clearly, the more the transition layer
extends closer to the surface, the more events with incomplete charge collection appear at
lower energies. Remarkably, both parameters seems to shift the position of the maximum of
the distribution.

\blocktitle{tuning the \\ model}
An attempt to fit the \Arl\ energy spectrum and extract FCCD and DLF values for each
detector has been carried on, whose preliminary results are presented here. The
\phasetwop\ data set (\gexpophasetwopbkg) has been considered, as the germanium detectors' energy threshold has
been kept low enough (about 40~keV) for the whole data taking. No LAr veto cut or PSD cut
has been applied, as the corresponding Monte Carlo model is not known in sufficient detail
yet or is completely missing. Each detector collected more than $5 \cdot 10^4$ events
below 200~keV, where the bulk of the \Arl\ events is located. \fillme{describe final

\end{figure}

\blocktitle{systematic \\ uncertainties}
There are systematic effects that might play a significant role in this analysis and that
could not be studied with the attention they deserve. These results are indeed preliminary
and should be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, a tentative list of the main
sources of systematic biases is given here for completeness.
\begin{description}
  \item[Quality cuts] The effectiveness of the quality cuts has never been verified in the
    \Arl\ energy region, where a large fraction of the total number of unphysical events
    can be expected. A quality cuts efficiency degrading around the energy threshold might
    induce deformations of the event energy distribution.
  \item[Energy scale and resolution] The correctness of the calibration and resolution
    curves of the germanium detector has never been investigated in detail at such low
    energies. The lowest \g\ line included in the calibration analysis is in fact at
    583~keV, which is even higher than the \Arl\ Q-value. As it can be speculated from
    \cref{fig:gedetav:ar39:distortions}, a systematic shift in the energy scale or
    resolution below the \Arl\ Q-value could mimic distortions corresponding to FCCD
    shifts. \fillme{news from Z\"urich here?}.
  \item[Transition layer model] A linear model for the CCE in the transition region has
    been used to keep the analysis simple. However, as it can be easily noticed by
    observing data close to the energy threshold, the approximation does not hold
    perfectly throughout the whole \Arl\ energy spectrum. More realistic models should be
    studied in order to asses whether the linear model introduces a severe bias in the
    results.
  \item[Background model] systematic effects arising from an incomplete or inexact
    background model in the low energy region cannot be excluded. As instance, a \Kr\
    contribution is known to be present in LAr (\g\ line at 514~keV) but is ignored in the
    present analysis. A fit of the \Kr\ pdf to the \g\ line visible in data, however,
    suggests a negligible contribution.
  \item[\Arl\ spectrum theoretical shape] The dynamics of the first-forbidden unique
    $\upbeta^-$ decay of \Arl\ are not known in great detail, from a theoretical point of
    view~\cite{Kostensalo2017}. The impact of different numerical calculations should be
    considered when performing such a shape analysis on its energy spectrum. However,
    judging from the order of magnitude of the distortions shown in~\cite{Kostensalo2017},
    this theoretical uncertainty should have a negligible impact.
