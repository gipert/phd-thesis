\chapter{Assay measurements}%
\label{apdx:assay}

This is a collection of the information that can be derived from screening measurements
done for \gerda\ \phasetwo. The measurements are converted to useful units for the
characterisation of prior distributions in the background modeling and other analysis. For
each measurement a recommendation is given on how to properly use the values. Part of
these measurements are published also in~\cite{Agostini2018a}. The following groups of
isotopes are assumed to be in secular equilibrium: [$^{228}$Ra, \Ac] [\Ra, \Bih, \Pbh]
[\Th, \Bil, \Tl] (branching ratio of \Tl\ is 0.36) [\Uh, \Pa].

  \caption{%
    Activity of \gerda\ \phasetwo\ components calculated from radio-purity screening
    measurements. Values colored in gray can be used as priors for \phasetwo\ background
    modeling as they are; Values colored in yellow are (partly) derived from ICPMS/NAA
    measurements under the assumption of secular equilibrium in the U/Th decay chains;
    values colored in light blue have to be multiplied by 2/3. This is an approximation
    for the shortening of the cables before deployment in \gerda.
