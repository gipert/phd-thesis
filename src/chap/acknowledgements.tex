\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express all my gratitude to my mentors Prof.~Riccardo Brugnera and
Prof.~Alberto Garfagnini, for welcoming me in their research group and providing me with
everything I needed to carry on my research project. Thank you for dedicating your time to
me, especially when things were going wrong, thank you for the intellectual honesty of
your advices, thank you for the opportunities you offered me and for helping me designing
my future as a researcher. I believe not so often a Ph.D.~student has the luck to receive
this kind of support and motivation from its research group.

A Ph.D.~research project is never a one-man effort. This thesis would not have been
successfully completed without the guidance and the collaboration of several people.
Before everyone, I would like to thank Katharina von Sturm for being the great person she
is, both as a physicist and as a human being. Thank you for being always there to help,
when life was tough. I wish everyone could have to possibility to work side to side with a
friend. I would like to thank all the people from the M\"unchen TUM group too, for
collaborating to the work presented in this thesis and for the many useful discussions.
Special thanks go to Matteo Agostini, Christoph Wiesinger and Elisabetta Bossio.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the help by Dr.~Jenny Kotila and Prof.~Francesco
Iachello, who kindly provided me with the theoretical calculations for two-neutrino
double-beta decay.
