\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express all my gratitude to my mentors Prof.~Riccardo Brugnera and
Prof.~Alberto Garfagnini, for welcoming me in their research group and providing me with
everything I needed to carry on my research project. Thank you for being available to help
promptly and in any occasion, thank you for the intellectual honesty of your advices,
thank you for helping me designing my future as a researcher. I believe not so often a
Ph.D.~student has the luck to receive this kind of support and motivation from its
research group.
\newpar
A Ph.D.~research project is never a one-man effort. This thesis work would not have been
successfully completed without the collaboration of several people. Before everyone, I
would like to thank Katharina~von~Sturm
